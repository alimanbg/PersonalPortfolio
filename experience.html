          <p>
            At CantoNet, I was the go-to person for making sense of our data. I
            built our analytics infrastructure from the ground up—setting up
            tracking, creating dashboards, and translating numbers into
            actionable insights. I also created the database and used Google
            Sheets along with Appscript to create a free task tracker that
            optimizes team efficiency, white letting poeple view, organize their
            tasks and receive gmail notifications.

            At Soap Cycling, I got to work with real world data fr the first
            time. I worked alongisde a team of 10 people towards a sustainable

            operations while working there, and got to meet so many people who
            enriched my experience as an international student in Hong Kong.
            Their business model had impressed me so much, especially their MEY
            project, that I did my Service Learning Project and University
